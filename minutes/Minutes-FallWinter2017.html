          <h4>Secretary</h4>
          <div class="event-content">
            Secretary Johnson reported that he is going to try to get two meetings scheduled per year for the College of Black Belts. One of these meetings will be during the Ryan Carden Memorial Tournament, and the other will likely be at some gathering of a significant number of members during the Winter or early Spring. He further reported that he is working on a new website for the Wu Chi Kung Fu Association, but that is its own item under old business.

            Treasurer Breitwieser had no report.

          <!-- The following is timeline of events within a section -->
              <h4></h4>
              <div class="event-content">Secretary Johnson stated that he is working on developing a new website for the Wu Chi Kung Fu Association, which will have a listing of all schools, some history, and both a member and non-member section so that meeting minutes and other non-public information can be stored there.</div>
              <h4></h4>
              <div class="event-content">Treasurer Breitwieser asked if, instead of a loading icon, can there be an icon that has the &#39;shame&#39; finger waving that Ryan used to do.</div>
              <h4></h4>
              <div class="event-content">Secretary Johnson confirmed that he could accomplish this. He further stated that he will need a profile from each of the black belts that they wish to have public-facing.</div>
          <br />
            <h3 class="subsection-title">2. Consideration of an IOLTA</h3>
          <!-- The following is timeline of events within a section -->
              <h4></h4>
              <div class="event-content">Treasurer Breitwieser stated he has an IOLTA and asked if we want to use it. He stated that an IOLTA is short for Interest on Lawyer&#39;s Trust Account, and is required when one is a practicing attorney. Treasurer Breitwieser stated that there really aren&#39;t any funds in it, other than the minimum required to keep it open. He stated that any interest that accrues within the IOLTA is not the property of the Association, but rather the state bar association, so if we wanted him to have a different account, he would be willing to do this.</div>
              <h4></h4>
              <div class="event-content">Secretary Johnson asked if there was any downside to simply using a standard checking or savings account.</div>
              <h4></h4>
              <div class="event-content">Treasurer Breitwieser responded that there is not. An IOLTA is just an account specifically designed for use by an attorney and doesn&#39;t incur fees like a business checking account might.</div>
              <h4></h4>
              <div class="event-content">W. Lovelace inquired whether checking accounts have fees.</div>
              <h4></h4>
              <div class="event-content">Secretary Johnson responded that they typically do, especially if they are business or organization accounts.</div>
              <h4></h4>
              <div class="event-content">W. Lovelace stated that it is probably not worth it to pay the fees to gain interest in a checking or savings account, since the interest is going to be so minimal anyway.</div>
              <h4></h4>
              <div class="event-content">P. Ferguson stated that if the bar association wanted the two or so dollars that we&#39;d accrue in interest, let them have it.</div>
              <h4></h4>
              <div class="event-content">Treasurer Breitwieser stated that these accounts are designed specifically to hold client funds.</div>
              <h4></h4>
              <div class="event-content">Vice Chair Ness asked if having Wu Chi Kung Fu Association funds in the account would affect Treasurer Breitwieser.</div>
              <h4></h4>
              <div class="event-content">Treasurer Breitwieser responded that it would not. He stated that since he is a government attorney, he doesn&#39;t have to have one. As such, anything that is done with it doesn&#39;t affect him, provided he doesn&#39;t mix personal funds with it.</div>
              <h4></h4>
              <div class="event-content">W. Lovelace stated that he thought it sounded like a good idea.</div>
              <h4></h4>
              <div class="event-content">Treasurer Breitwieser stated that we don&#39;t have any money anyway, so it doesn&#39;t really matter.</div>
              <h4></h4>
              <div class="event-content">Secretary Johnson stated that P. Ough has given him funds that are earmarked for the school plaques and he has been using the Sinking Moon accounts for this purpose. He stated that there are five plaques that funds have been allocated for, and two of these, the Grand Forks school, and Judd&#39;s school, have yet to be purchased and delivered.</div>
              <h4></h4>
              <div class="event-content">P. Ferguson thanked P. Ough for providing the funds for this purpose.</div>
              <h4></h4>
              <div class="event-content">Treasurer Breitwieser stated that if, in the event of an issue with the IOLTA, he will open another separate account for the organization.</div>
              <h4>Motion</h4>
              <div class="event-content">
                Vice Chair Ness moved to utilize Treasurer Breitwieser&#39;s IOLTA for Wu Chi Kung Fu Association funds.
              </div>

            <h3 class="subsection-title">1. WCCBB-RES-2017-1: Amendment to Retire the Title of Chief Executive Instructor in Favor of &#39;Chair&#39;</h3>
          <!-- The following is timeline of events within a section -->
              <h4></h4>
              <div class="event-content">Secretary Johnson acknowledged that he wrote this resolution. He gave a brief overview of the intent of the resolution, which is to make it clear in the constitution that the title of Chief Executive Instructor is specific to Chair Cecil, and that, upon his retirement, it is not necessary for the role to be assigned to someone else.</div>
              <h4></h4>
              <div class="event-content">Treasurer Breitwieser stated that he liked the idea of the change, but that he did not want to take the title away from Chair Cecil. He asked when the change would take effect.</div>
              <h4></h4>
              <div class="event-content">P. Ferguson stated that it only takes effect when Chair Cecil steps down.</div>
              <h4></h4>
              <div class="event-content">Treasurer Breitwieser refuted this, saying that if we were to amend the consitution based on the language in the resolution as-is, the title will not be there at all.</div>
              <h4></h4>
              <div class="event-content">Secretary Johnson stated that the resolution can be amended. He further clarified that the reason he and R. Huus brought this resolution up was to get discussion started on this topic.</div>
              <h4></h4>
              <div class="event-content">Secretary Johnson clarified the language of the resolution and confirmed that there is no time when the constitutional changes would take effect, thus, he stated they would take effect immediately if the resolution were adopted.</div>
              <h4></h4>
              <div class="event-content">Treasurer Breitwieser suggested adding a section about maintaing the role of Chief Executive Instructor while Chair Cecil retains his office. He stated the best place to put this addition would be right after the language discussion how the role is unnecessary after Chair Cecil&#39;s retirement.</div>
              <h4></h4>
              <div class="event-content">P. Ferguson and Vice Chair Ness confirmed they would like to see something similar about how everyone after Chair Cecil will retain the role of Chair, but not the role of Chief Executive Instructor, and that this role is specific to Chair Cecil alone.</div>
              <h4></h4>
              <div class="event-content">Z. Voltin recommended having two separate roles: one of Chairperson and Chief Executive Instructor, and the latter being held by Chair Cecil alone and noone else upon his retirement.</div>
              <h4></h4>
              <div class="event-content">Secretary Johnson stated that this is the goal of the resolution. He stated that, within the constitution as it stands, it&#39;s not clear where the separation between Chair and Chief Executive Instructor actually is. Secretary Johnson reiterated that the point of the resolution is to make the language reflect the reality of the two roles as they are being practiced.</div>
              <h4></h4>
              <div class="event-content">W. Lovelace stated that he thinks the two wordings will result in the same effect, and that he would be in support of either.</div>
              <h4></h4>
              <div class="event-content">Secretary Johnson stated he would re-word the resolution and that it can be brought up either at the next meeting, or via email.</div>
              <h4>Motion</h4>
              <div class="event-content">
                Treasurer Breitwieser moved to table discussion of WCCBB-RES-2017-1 until our next meeting.
              </div>
                <h4>Second</h4>
                <div class="event-content">Seconded by Vice Chair Ness.</div>
              <h4>Vote</h4>
              <div class="event-content">17-0-0;

          <br />
            <h3 class="subsection-title">2. WCCBB-RES-2017-2: Amendment to More Clearly Define Roles of Executive Officers</h3>
          <!-- The following is timeline of events within a section -->
              <h4></h4>
              <div class="event-content">Secretary Johnson stated that he wrote this resolution as well, and that it defines the officer roles. He stated that the resolution contains seven officer roles: Chair, Vice Chair, Secretary, Treasurer, Keeper of the Scroll, and two Officer-At-Large roles. Secretary Johnson stated that the college can vote on each role individually, or as a group. He said that he put names alongside those performing the roles as of now, but if we want to hold formal elections of office, that can be done, as well. Secretary Johnson stated that he has received notification of both Z. Voltin and P. Ough as being interested in the Officer-At-Large positions. He nominated them for those respective positions. Secretary Johnson also defined the Officer-At-Large role as one where tasks aren&#39;t as well-defined as other roles, but rather they will assist the other officers with tasks when they are overburdened.</div>
              <h4></h4>
              <div class="event-content">Vice Chair Ness asked how many officer roles there are defined in the resolution.</div>
              <h4></h4>
              <div class="event-content">Secretary Johnson responded that there are seven, but that that can be voted upon as well. He stated he wanted an odd number of officers.</div>
              <h4></h4>
              <div class="event-content">Vice Chair Ness clarified that he was asking how many Officer-At-Large roles were defined in the resolution.</div>
              <h4></h4>
              <div class="event-content">Secretary Johnson stated there are two.</div>
              <h4></h4>
              <div class="event-content">W. Lovelace asked if the roles were administrative in nature. He clarified that what he wanted to know is whether the officer roles had special privileges regarding bringing motions to the table, or other things that they alone could do that normal members could not.</div>
              <h4></h4>
              <div class="event-content">Secretary Johnson stated that all members of the College could bring motions to the table, and that the purpose of the officers was administrative in nature. He further clarified that the officers do not get additional votes, but are merely ways of assigning names to general, everyday tasks that need to be completed so that they get done in an orderly manner. Secretary Johnson said that no officer has any additional decision-making power, within this resolution, that other members of the College don&#39;t have.</div>
              <h4></h4>
              <div class="event-content">Treasurer Breitwieser stated that any officer of an organization can be used to effect service, for the purposes of a legal dispute. He stated that this means that, if the Wu Chi Kung Fu Association were to be litigated against, serving notification of a lawsuit to any officer is effectively serving the notification to the organization. Treasurer Breitwieser stated that, for this reason, some organizations minimize the number of officer roles they choose to have in order to make serving lawsuits to the organization more difficult.</div>
              <h4></h4>
              <div class="event-content">Secretary Johnson stated that, regardless, someone wanting to sue the organization would be able to find an officer to serve to. He said that just because an organization has fewer officer roles, it doesn&#39;t mean that they are less likely to have a suit filed against them.</div>
              <h4></h4>
              <div class="event-content">Treasurer Breitwieser said that having fewer officer roles does not protect you from a lawsuit, but improper service can protect you from a lawsuit. He said that he had no issue with the number of officer roles, it&#39;s just something to consider before we make the decision to have additional Officer-At-Large positions. Treasurer Breitwiser stated that if one limits the avenues of proper service, it makes it more difficult to bring suit against the organization.</div>
              <h4></h4>
              <div class="event-content">Treasurer Breitwiser stated that if we accept the officer roles, we need to make sure that every officer is aware that someone may serve them papers, and if so, they have to accept service and notify the organization immediately.</div>
              <h4></h4>
              <div class="event-content">Vice Chair Ness inquired as to whether this means that every officer must accept service for lawsuites against each and every school underneath the association, or just lawsuits naming the association as a whole.</div>
              <h4></h4>
              <div class="event-content">Treasurer Breitwieser responded that it depends on how the suit is written, but generally, it&#39;s just the association. He stated that, typically, lawsuits will start with individual schools first, and only move up to naming the association if it&#39;s something that they think is a grievance caused by the overarching organization.</div>
              <h4></h4>
              <div class="event-content">Secretary Johnson inquired why Treasurer Breitwieser kept pointing to him when discussing lawsuits.</div>
              <h4></h4>
              <div class="event-content">Treasurer Breitwieser stated that he thought it unlikely that the lawyer would be the one most likely to get sued, and Secretary Johnson happened to be sitting across from him.</div>
              <h4></h4>
              <div class="event-content">Vice Chair Ness stated he would hide behind the lawyer unless there was gunfire.</div>
              <h4></h4>
              <div class="event-content">P. Ferguson stated he would hide behind the lawyer especially if there was gunfire.</div>
              <h4></h4>
              <div class="event-content">Secretary Johnson stated that this resolution should probably be fixed and voted upon during this meeting, since the organization is essentially in a limbo right now without clearly defined officer roles.</div>
              <h4></h4>
              <div class="event-content">P. Ferguson inquired whether the roles were permenant or whether there would be regular elections for officer positions.</div>
              <h4></h4>
              <div class="event-content">Secretary Johnson stated there are no term limits on officer roles. He stated that anyone can voluntarily give up their officer role, but the organization does not have regular elections on officer roles. Secretary Johnson stated that he thinks that having fresh blood and turnaround in officer roles is a good thing, but because our organization is small right now, it&#39;s more efficient if we have the same people doing the same jobs - it offers continuity.</div>
              <h4></h4>
              <div class="event-content">P. Ferguson stated he agreed with Secretary Johnson. He thought that we didn&#39;t have enough people to replace those already in office, if there were regular elections.</div>
              <h4></h4>
              <div class="event-content">W. Lovelace indicated he did not need to be an officer, but he said he was happy to help out if any of the officers needed assistance with their work.</div>
              <h4></h4>
              <div class="event-content">Secretary Johnson asked the College whether anyone had any amendments to the resolution as it was written.</div>
              <h4></h4>
              <div class="event-content">Treasurer Breitwieser pointed out that if the existing officers became overburdened, the College could entertain a motion to increase the number of officer roles at that time.</div>
              <h4>Motion</h4>
              <div class="event-content">
                Secretary Johnson moved that the College of Black Belts approve WCCBB-RES-2017-2 as written.

              <div class="event-content">Secretary Johnson stated that this resolution was actually originally inspired by R. Huus and that he just worded it.</div>
              <h4></h4>
              <div class="event-content">R. Huus stated that the past few Ryan Carden Memorial Tournaments he&#39;s attended have had few, if any, references to Sifu Ryan Carden. He stated that he would prefer if there was more effort given toward educating new students about Sifu Ryan, since they didn&#39;t have the opportunity to get to know him, especially since the tournament is being conducted in his name. R. Huus stated that he felt that we should involve Ryan more in the tournament or that we should change the name of the tournament.</div>
              <h4></h4>
              <div class="event-content">Secretary Johnson stated that he wanted to offer some clarification on how the resolution came to be worded. He stated that R. Huus and he talked about much of what R. Huus just mentioned, and this is reflected in the wording of the resolution, but that there were also a number of related issues that needed to be discussed. Secretary Johnson stated that the issues with miscommunication with this year&#39;s tournament and the organization surrounding this year&#39;s tournament made the event less effective, in his opinion, than it normally would be. He stated that it was his opinion that the head instructor of the school wishing to host the tournament for a given year must ask the College, in person, with no proxy requests allowed, to host the tournament.</div>
              <h4></h4>
              <div class="event-content">Treasurer Breitwieser asked what would happen if noone asked to host the tournament.</div>
              <h4></h4>
              <div class="event-content">Secretary Johnson stated that he hadn&#39;t considered that possibility.</div>
              <h4></h4>
              <div class="event-content">P. Ferguson suggested that the College use a lottery system to decide which school would host the tournament should that situation arise.</div>
              <h4></h4>
              <div class="event-content">Secretary Johnson stated that the College didn&#39;t have a rule on this prior to now. He argued that this resolution wouldn&#39;t be changing anything that was in place prior to now for this particular situation.</div>
              <h4></h4>
              <div class="event-content">Treasurer Breitwieser asked if we change the rules to make it so someone has to ask, and noone asks, whether we would then not have a tournament for that year.</div>
              <h4></h4>
              <div class="event-content">Secretary Johnson stated that perhaps the language of the resolution needs to be changed, but that the intention was to make it so someone else can&#39;t ask on your behalf. He gave the example that if he weren&#39;t at the meeting where this was discussed, R. Huus couldn&#39;t volunteer Secretary Johnson&#39;s school for the tournament.</div>
              <h4></h4>
              <div class="event-content">W. Lovelace stated that if noone asks to host the tournament, he doesn&#39;t think that we should force anyone to do it. He stated that there will be back channels that aren&#39;t official anyway where people will be talking about this prior to the official meeting, so it&#39;s going to be known that there isn&#39;t a location for a given year.</div>
              <h4></h4>
              <div class="event-content">Secretary Johnson stated that we can just add language to default to the Grand Forks school whenever there&#39;s a dispute.</div>
              <h4></h4>
              <div class="event-content">R. Huus suggested that since the most active schools at this time were in the Twin Cities and Grand Forks, if noone volunteered, we could agree to host the tournament somewhere in between those two locations to make it convienient for all parties.</div>
              <h4></h4>
              <div class="event-content">Treasurer Breitwieser looked affronted and said that he saw where this was heading, given that he was the only place &#39;in between&#39; the Twin Cities and Grand Forks.</div>
              <h4></h4>
              <div class="event-content">P. Ferguson stated that he wouldn&#39;t be in support of changing the name of the tournament. He stated that he thought it would be better to carve out specific time during the tournament to specifically honor Ryan and discuss his history with the current participants. P. Ferguson stated that taking away the name would be a dishonor to both Ryan and Dashi Gary, since this was the reason Dashi Gary started the tournament to begin with.</div>
              <h4></h4>
              <div class="event-content">Secretary Johnson clarified that within the resolution is language stated very specifically that at least one event must involve Sifu Ryan Carden in some way.</div>
              <h4></h4>
              <div class="event-content">R. Huus stated that he has concerns that as more and more generations of students become involved in the schools, and we don&#39;t specifically honor Sifu Ryan, then we get into a situation where noone knows why the tournament is named the way it is anymore except for those few &#39;old school&#39; individuals still around that trained under Ryan. He said he was concerned that this would get lost once more as he believes it has.</div>
              <h4></h4>
              <div class="event-content">Secretary Johnson said that this was no different from any other sport. He said that often in, for example, hockey, there will be an annual tournament that has the name of a child who died of cancer at an early age on the tournament. Secretary Johnson said that many of the individual participants don&#39;t know who that person was, they simply know they are coming to participate in a hockey tournament. He said that, often, the tournament directors will have a presentation at the start of the tournament explaining why the tournament is named the way it is, and that we should have something similar at the very least.</div>
              <h4></h4>
              <div class="event-content">P. Ferguson stated that he thought that something like this at the beginning of the tournament might be a good idea for the new generations that didn&#39;t have the opportunity to learn from Sifu Ryan.</div>
              <h4></h4>
              <div class="event-content">Treasurer Breitwieser stated that he agrees and that we should keep a tradition of honoring Ryan alive in order to educate the next generations of students about who came before them.</div>
              <h4></h4>
              <div class="event-content">P. Ferguson stated that we need to mandate that every school that hosts&#x2F;plans the tournament needs to have something with Ryan in it, as talking points about who he was, or techniques that they specifically learned from Ryan, or something similar.</div>
              <h4></h4>
              <div class="event-content">W. Lovelace stated that he liked how the resolution was worded.</div>
              <h4></h4>
              <div class="event-content">P. Ferguson agreed and said that he also thought the resolution was worded well.</div>
              <h4></h4>
              <div class="event-content">Treasurer Breitwieser stated that when he was in law school, there was a memorial golf tournament named after someoone who was important to the law school. He said that they did a similar introduction to what Secretary Johnson talked about in his example, and that was the point of honoring them with the name of the tournament in that it forced everyone to consider who this person was and why they mattered. Treasurer Breitwieser stated that he didn&#39;t think that simply because we progress as an organization and expand that we need to change the name of the tournament due to the fact that more and more people no longer know who Ryan was.</div>
              <h4></h4>
              <div class="event-content">P. Ferguson said that we&#39;ll have enough to pass on to future generations that came from Ryan that they don&#39;t necessarily need to have met him in person.</div>
              <h4></h4>
              <div class="event-content">Treasurer Breitwiser said that he thought it was important to do this memorial ceremony every tournament because of that reason. He said that way, students will know where this knowledge came from, and who influenced those who influence them.</div>
              <h4></h4>
              <div class="event-content">Vice Chair Ness said that he thought an idea brought up previously by Secretary Johnson with the goal of forming a committee made up of representatives of multiple schools to assist in planning the tournament each year was a good idea. He said he thought this would give consistency to the tournament events and ensure that items like the introduction and ceremonies aren&#39;t forgotten from year to year.</div>
              <h4></h4>
              <div class="event-content">Secretary Johnson pointed out that the only challenge with having a committee organize an event like this is that there is a conflict that&#39;s generated if the committee is deciding what will be done, but the host school is financing the tournament. He said that every instructor is going to want to add their own flare and change the tournament to reflect their personality. Secretary Johnson said that he thought that if we moved toward a model where the committee dictated what the tournament content would be, then we should also move toward having the overarching organization finance the tournament as well.</div>
              <h4></h4>
              <div class="event-content">P. Ferguson said that he thought that was fair. He said that one thing that could be done to resolve that potential conflict is to make the committee in charge of the more routine aspects of the tournament, such as items that are required to be included every year.</div>
              <h4></h4>
              <div class="event-content">Secretary Johnson said that he designed this resolution to be flexible, and in his opinion, this is really the first step toward a model like what&#39;s been described. He said that the intent isn&#39;t to impose a bunch of rules on tournament hosts, but at the same time, to begin moving us toward a more structured and reproducible event each year.</div>
              <h4></h4>
              <div class="event-content">W. Lovelace said that the committee doesn&#39;t need to dictate to the host school or instructor, but rather be guidance for what has worked or not worked at past events. He said that this offers continuity for future events. W. Lovelace said the committee could be giving advice, and it&#39;s up to the host school or instructor to take them or not.</div>
              <h4></h4>
              <div class="event-content">Vice Chair Ness said he didn&#39;t think Ryan would want the tournament to be a hardship financially on whichever school was hosting it.</div>
              <h4></h4>
              <div class="event-content">P. Ferguson agreed that Ryan would likely not want that.</div>
              <h4></h4>
              <div class="event-content">Secretary Johnson said he didn&#39;t think it has been a hardship, but that this year, for example, there was an undue amount of pressure put on J. Stansbury. Secretary Johnson said that he didn&#39;t think J. Stansbury was expecting either the amount of pressure that he encountered, nor the lack of turnout that happened. He said that he thought what could be done to learn from this situation is to try to nail some of the details down more incrementally and further in advance so there would be less pressure closer to the date of the event itself. Secretary Johnson said that, while this is later in the meeting, if the Sinking Moon School hosts the tournament in 2018, he will commit to providing a continuity document stating what was done, when things were planned, what issues were encountered that were unexpected, and so forth. He said that this would be provided to each subsequent head instructor hosting the tournament so they can hopefully learn from each successive iteration to make the event better.</div>
              <h4></h4>
              <div class="event-content">P. Ferguson stated he thought this was a good idea.</div>
              <h4></h4>
              <div class="event-content">Z. Voltin stated that he agreed with P. Ferguson and W. Lovelace in the idea that we should have some formal document, either in the Constitution, By-laws, or some other permenant document, which defines the set of things that compose the &#39;Ryan Carden Memorial Tournament&#39;. He said that this document should make it clear which events are required at each tournament that make it &#39;the&#39; tournament. Z. Voltin also stated that while he agreed with Vice Chair Ness&#39; idea of having a committee, he thought the committee should be advisory in nature only. He said that this committee would not have any power to enforce their will on the head instructor hosting the tournament, but that they were expected to advise the head instructor in matters related to the tournament, with the head instructor having the final say about what will or will not occur. Z. Voltin said this will provide a panel of experts that others who are less experienced with how to host an event like this can draw on, but they don&#39;t necessarily have to get approval for anything. He said that, in this way, every head instructor wouldn&#39;t need to become an &#39;expert&#39; at the Ryan Carden Memorial Tournament, because they would have a panel of experienced people whom they could draw upon.</div>
              <h4></h4>
              <div class="event-content">Secretary Johnson stated that he thought this was a really good idea.</div>
              <h4></h4>
              <div class="event-content">Vice Chair Ness agreed that this was a good idea.</div>
              <h4></h4>
              <div class="event-content">Secretary Johnson asked the College how they thought he should handle this. He said he thought this committee has a good place in the By-laws of the organization, and he can write it up as a separate resolution if others would like him to. He said we could amend the current resolution tonight if others felt that was in order.</div>
              <h4></h4>
              <div class="event-content">W. Lovelace said that he thought the formation of a committee for this purpose was fine by itself as a standalone resolution unrelated to the one currently being discussed.</div>
              <h4></h4>
              <div class="event-content">Secretary Johnson said that the College should plan on voting on that via email, since he would have to take some time to prepare the resolution.</div>
              <h4>Point of Order</h4>
              <div class="event-content">Secretary Johnson said that, aside from a single vote tonight where Z. Voltin abstained, he didn&#39;t think there had been a single vote that hadn&#39;t been unanimous yet in the meetings of the College. Secretary Johnson said that if there is a vote where it appears unclear that it passed based on verbal vote to any member of the College, or if any member wanted to force a roll call vote, you can say &#39;Division&#39;, which will force a roll call vote to be taken, where each member present states their name and their vote for the record. He said the only time when this doesn&#39;t apply is if the Constitution or By-laws specifically call for a secret ballot vote, in which case, that would be the process regardless, and no verbal vote would be taken.</div>
              <h4>Motion</h4>
              <div class="event-content">
                R. Huus moved to approve resolution WCCBB-RES-2017-3 as written.

            <h3 class="subsection-title">4. 2018 Sifu Ryan Carden Memorial Tournament</h3>
          <!-- The following is timeline of events within a section -->
              <h4></h4>
              <div class="event-content">Secretary Johnson stated that he, as the Head Instructor of the Sinking Moon School of Kung Fu, hereby formally requests that the 2018 Sifu Ryan Carden Memorial Tournament be hosted by the Sinking Moon School of Kung Fu.</div>
              <h4></h4>
              <div class="event-content">Vice Chair Ness stated that the request was denied.</div>
              <h4></h4>
              <div class="event-content">Secretary Johnson noted that Vice Chair Ness was kidding, and wondered aloud whether he had been waiting all year to say that last comment.</div>
              <h4></h4>
              <div class="event-content">Vice Chair Ness asked Secretary Johnson if he was aware that 2018 will be the fifth anniversary of the Ryan Carden Memorial Tournament.</div>
              <h4></h4>
              <div class="event-content">Secretary Johnson said he was aware and that this was part of the reason that he was adamant that we continue to have the tournament this year, as if we skipped a year, he wasn&#39;t sure whether it would still be the fifth annual Sifu Ryan Carden Memorial Tournament or the fourth annual or something else since we hadn&#39;t held it consecutively.</div>
              <h4></h4>
              <div class="event-content">W. Lovelace said that it is cooler than the first, but not as flashy as the tenth.</div>
              <h4></h4>
              <div class="event-content">Secretary Johnson said the first gets a special name, even, as it&#39;s called the &#39;Inaugural&#39;.</div>
              <h4></h4>
              <div class="event-content">Treasurer Breitwieser asked Secretary Johnson when the tournament would be in terms of dates.</div>
              <h4></h4>
              <div class="event-content">Secretary Johnson said he didn&#39;t have that information yet.</div>
              <h4></h4>
              <div class="event-content">Treasurer Breitwiser chastised Secretary Johnson for not having this information, given that we had literally just approved a motion mandating that the dates be set at least six months in advance, and that Secretary Johnson had written this resolution no less.</div>
              <h4></h4>
              <div class="event-content">Secretary Johnson said he had a good reason for not knowing, though. He said it depends on P. Ough&#39;s schedule and when he can make it back from overseas. Secretary Johnson said he wanted to try to make it as inclusive for all of the black belts as possible, and that he had promised P. Ough that he would try to make sure it aligned with a time when he was back on the mainland. Secretary Johnson said it would probably be end of June or early July.</div>
              <h4></h4>
              <div class="event-content">Treasurer Breitwiser said that Secretary Johnson didn&#39;t necessarily need to take this into account, but that June sucked for him in terms of schedule.</div>
              <h4></h4>
              <div class="event-content">Secretary Johnson said it was possible that P. Ough wouldn&#39;t be back over the winter and would be working overtime, and thus he thought that this might complicate the schedule, throwing the tournament into later August. He said he would try to get the dates ironed out as soon as possible. Secretary Johnson stated that, if there are dates that anyone knows don&#39;t work for them in late Summer or early Fall next year, let him know as soon in advance as possible so he can try to work around them.</div>
              <h4>Motion</h4>
              <div class="event-content">
                Secretary Johnson moved that the 2018 Sifu Ryan Carden Memorial Tournament be hosted by the Sinking Moon School of Kung Fu in Rosemount, MN.

          <!-- The following is timeline of events within a section -->
              <h4></h4>
              <div class="event-content">Treasurer Breitwieser stated he was in agreement that we should recognize Ryan, but that he thought we had already done this at the first tournament.</div>
              <h4></h4>
              <div class="event-content">Secretary Johnson said that there had been some confusion lately about what rank Ryan was actually supposed to be. He said he had spoken with Dashi Gary recently and that Gary had stated that his intention was, at the time of the announcement of the first tournament that he awarded Ryan the title of Sifu and the rank of fourth level black belt. Secretary Johnson said that it was unfortunate that Chair Cecil wasn&#39;t in attendance at the meeting, as he could explain it more clearly, but that it sounded as though the intent was that it be recorded in the minutes that Ryan was awarded the rank of both fourth level and the title of Sifu at the first tournament.</div>
              <h4></h4>
              <div class="event-content">P. Ferguson said that this wasn&#39;t news to him and that he thought this was the way things were.</div>
              <h4></h4>
              <div class="event-content">Vice Chair Ness said that there is a technical distinction between fourth level and the title of Sifu.</div>
              <h4></h4>
              <div class="event-content">P. Ferguson said that making sure it&#39;s recorded in the minutes is a good idea.</div>
              <h4></h4>
              <div class="event-content">Vice Chair Ness asked Secretary Johnson whether this should take effect at the memorial service for Ryan or the first tournament.</div>
              <h4></h4>
              <div class="event-content">Secretary Johnson said that Vice Chair Ness was correct and that technically speaking, the award of rank to Ryan and title change happened at the memorial service and not at the first tournament.</div>
              <h4>Point of Order</h4>
              <div class="event-content">Secretary Johnson said that no motion was necessary since this was just an acknowledgement of something that had already occurred.</div>
              <h4></h4>
              <div class="event-content">Vice Chair Ness said he was second to receive his fourth level now.</div>

              <h4></h4>
              <div class="event-content">Secretary Johnson said that he thought everyone saw J. Stansbury&#39;s email stating that he would be resigning his position with the College.</div>
              <h4>Point of Order</h4>
              <div class="event-content">Secretary Johnson said he thought the College had to vote on J. Stansbury&#39;s resignation.</div>

              <h4></h4>
              <div class="event-content">Secretary Johnson said he thought, in retrospect, that Treasurer Breitwieser was correct because the Constitution does give a provision for resignation of membership.</div>
              <h4></h4>
              <div class="event-content">Vice Chair Ness stated that, with regret, the College accepts the resignation of J. Stansbury from its membership.</div>
              <h4></h4>
              <div class="event-content">Secretary Johnson stated that he would not be removing J. Stansbury from the College email list, since it was easier to have a single email list with all of the black belts than to manage separate lists based on who was a member of the College and who was not. He also stated that J. Stansbury&#39;s lack of membership in the College in no way impacts his standing as head instructor of Immortal Soul Martial Arts.</div>
